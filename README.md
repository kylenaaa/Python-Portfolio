# Python-Portfolio
This repository contains my Data Analytics portfolio projects in Python. I use Jupyter Notebook.


## [1 - Pokemon Analysis](https://github.com/kylenaaa/Python-Portfolio/tree/main/1%20-%20Pokemon%20Analysis)
Based on DataWars sample filtering and sorting exercises. Got a separate csv file from [Armgilles](https://gist.github.com/armgilles/194bcff35001e7eb53a2a8b441e8b2c6). 



## [2 - Google Play Store Apps Analysis](https://github.com/kylenaaa/Python-Portfolio/tree/main/2%20-%20Google%20Play%20Store%20Apps%20Analysis)
Based on DataWars sample data cleaning exercises. Got the csv file from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lava18/google-play-store-apps/).
