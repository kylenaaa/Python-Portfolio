# Python-Portfolio
This repository contains my Data Analytics portfolio projects in Python. I use Jupyter Notebook.


## 1 - Pokemon Analysis
Based on DataWars sample filtering and sorting exercises. I got a separate csv file from [Armgilles](https://gist.github.com/armgilles/194bcff35001e7eb53a2a8b441e8b2c6). 


## 2 - Pokemon Analysis
Based on DataWars sample data cleaning exercises. I got the csv file from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lava18/google-play-store-apps/).
